<img class="larger-image thick-black-border center center" src="IMG_0929.jpg" alt="Orange sky, a lot of clouds, tint of red, with a silhouette of a Palm Tree">
<img class="larger-image thick-black-border center center" src="IMG_9465.jpg" alt="Butterfly on a flower, yellow flowers, lots of flowers, tint of purple on the photo. And grain on the photo.">     
<img class="larger-image thick-black-border center center" src="IMG_1904.jpg" alt="A fence, with an opening at the top of it, over the fence, a yellow horizon with lots of clouds with tints of purple and gold.">
<img class="larger-image thick-black-border center center" src="IMG_1834.jpg" alt="A blue sky, on the freeway, with a mountain overhead. A blue moody color. Clouds that are blue.">    
<img class="larger-image thick-black-border center center" src="IMG_2463.jpg" alt="A red sky in Balboa Park, a silhouette of a Palm Tree and Historical Buildings. The sky has tints of orange and red, and a tiny bit of purple. Street lights under even though it is a silhouette. They can be seen. A an unseen fountain in the dark in the silhouette. Two birds on the top left of the image flying, far away into the horizon.">
<img class="larger-image thick-black-border center center" src="IMG_0607.jpg" alt="Silhouette of Palm Trees and electricty wire lines. With the main subject being the sun, the sky is golden warm. And the sun shining so bright, you cannot see it's shape.">    
<img class="larger-image thick-black-border center center" src="IMG_2183.jpg" alt="A electricity box in downtown, with a mysterious face painting. Eyes black, nose black, and mouth open. The paint running down on the eyes, nose, and mouth. The facial structure being the electricity box. Looks like a skeleton, back of the photo overlapping, there is a construction sign that has been abandoned. No Parking Two Away AM to PM with the times crossed out. However, on saturday there is an X. Overlapping to the construction sign there is a lock. Upside down so you don't have to reach down to open it. The meaning of this photo is death and time.">
<img class="larger-image thick-black-border center center" src="IMG_2408.jpg" alt="Picture of a squirrel, looking right at you. Curious squirrel, a very close up photo. Next to a bush with lots of thorns and needles. A green bush. The needles purpleish. A dried out leaf, the color brown. Grass next to the squirrel. The squirrel is on the pavement. Looking back at you, creation.">
<img class="larger-image thick-black-border center center" src="IMG_1892.jpg" alt="Photo of a horizon. The clouds are green tinted, heavenly looking. Because the sun is shining through a tiny opening in the clouds. A sign from Heaven, I like to call it. The sun shining very bright and very warm looking. A warm color of gold. Opening all over the clouds, radiating light and the light unstoppable.">     
<img class="larger-image thick-black-border center center" src="IMG_0610-2.jpg" alt= "An orange red sky, as if painted with swerves and curves. 3 palm trees being the main subject. With a huge tree in the bottom of the palm trees. The bottom? Because the palm trees are very huge. Tall. Super tall. Electric wires behind the palm trees. Close to the bottom of the palm trees the sky that is yellow gold that is emitting warm gold color because the sun is setting.">
<img class="larger-image thick-black-border center center" src="IMG_1909.jpg" alt="A sky, neon in the bottom, turning blue at the top middle section. Shading of different colors. Blue neon and greenish tint. A clouds the shape of a Z, or anything your mind could imagine. Almost looks like a girl running on a cloud. Clouds under it like a train has smoke coming out from the top. Tiny clouds under the main cloud. Under the main cloud, there is a mountain, far away, so far. And clouds behind it. Very huge and curvy and lots of shapes. Clouds the color yellow, a warm yellow gold. Warm like fire. The mountains have a purple tint. A touch of purple. And you can see the mist far away, so far in the clouds. Yet I was near a school. The school sign in the photo. Cars driving by. A crosswalk sign because it is a school. Rainbow clouds.">     
<img class="larger-image thick-black-border center center" src="IMG_2067.jpg" alt="A staircase, entrapped with bars around it. You have to go to this gate to go down the stairs. The stairs made of metal with brail marking. Metal bars to hold yourself while going down the stairs. The color of the surroundings and the stairs are blood red. With a tint of orange, a tiny tint. The stairs lead to this dark space, you cannot even see in the photo. It is very dark. A mystery. The photo represents choices, will you come up from the darkness? Or will you go where you are so comfortable. In sin, chaos. Or fight your way to the gate, representing Heaven and God. Jesus Christ. Will you fight till the end? Or live in your sin?">
<img class="larger-image thick-black-border center center" src="IMG_0708.jpg" alt="A purple sky, silhouette of the cars and automated stop signs. The ones cars use to go around anywhere. A silhouette of a building, far away, and the sky very purple. A bird silhouette on the top of lamppost. The sky purple. Tints of dark purple at the top, and very purple at the bottom.">     
<img class="larger-image thick-black-border center center" src="IMG_2106.jpg" alt="A sculpture of a man, large nose, small eyes, tiny forehead, small lips. Curly hair, with a bandana in his curly hair. Face shaped, oval. With a neckbrace, seemingly looking like he's trapped. Not the neckbrace you get from the doctor, a metal one, kind of like a pillory. With a ball in the bottom. The neckbrace with a ball. Kind of like the ones people have at their doors. You grab it and bang it. Shaped like a U. And flowers at the top of the sculpture. Flowing, the photo black and white. Greyish tone. The flowers are fading, they have a fading effect to them. Because of the shutter speed used to take this photo. It represents time. As it fades away. Trapped in it. But still moving forward.">
<img class="larger-image thick-black-border center center" src="IMG_1273.jpg" alt="Photo of my Mother and her Husband. The day of their marriage. Kissing eachother, with the pastor in the middle of the photo. Tiny crack under their chins as they kiss. The woman with a white huge beautiful dress, and the man in a blue suit. With a flower in the middle as they kiss. A white flower.  ">    
<img class="larger-image thick-black-border center center" src="IMG_1221.jpg" alt="My Mother and my Grandpa, her father. Looking at eachother standing up. My Mothers hand in between his elbow. Like when you put your arm in the inside part of the elbow as you walk. My Mother and Grandpa looking at eachother. Smiling. Very happy. Her Father in a black suit. Black tie. My Mom in her white dress, holding her flowers. White flowers. Lots of them. A bouquet.">
<img class="larger-image thick-black-border center center" src="IMG_1486.jpg" alt="Photo of my Mothers husband and his Mother. Holding eachother very tight. Very very tight. Almost as if she has to let him go forever. Tears of joy, paing and struggle. Tears of the past. Tears in memories. Holding eachother so tight. Not letting go. Crying.">
